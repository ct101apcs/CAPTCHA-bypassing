## Usage

Since the datasets are large, we chose to ignore them in the repository. You can download the datasets from the following links:

After receiving the file *archive.zip*, extract it to a folder name "Datasets/" in the root directory of the project. The folder structure should look like this:

```bash
├── root/Datasets/
│   ├── archive/
│       ├── animals/
│           ├── animals/
```
